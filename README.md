  - 📦 Per-command output blocks
  - ⏹️ Stop running command
  - 📁 `cd` session directory handling
  - ➕ "Add to processes" for commands you want to manage long-term

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- ⚡ **Desktop shell:** Tauri 2 (Rust)
- 🎨 **Frontend:** Vue 3 + TypeScript + Pinia
- 📈 **Monitoring:** `sysinfo`
- 🪟 **Windows integration:** tray icon/menu + registry auto-start (`winreg`)

## 📋 Requirements

- 🪟 Windows 10/11
- 🟢 Node.js 18+
- 🦀 Rust toolchain (stable)
- 🌐 WebView2 Runtime (usually already present on modern Windows)

## 🚀 Quick Start

Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Run desktop app in development:

```bash
bun run tauri dev
```

Frontend-only dev server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Build production web assets:

```bash
bun run build
```

Build production desktop app:

```bash
bun run tauri build
```

## 📖 Using the App

### ⚡ Manage processes

1. Click **New Process** in the sidebar.
2. Enter a name + command (+ optional working directory).
3. Use row actions to start/stop/restart.
4. Select a process to inspect logs and metrics in the right panel.

### 🖥️ Use the integrated terminal

1. Click the terminal button (`>_`) in the titlebar.
2. Run commands directly in the terminal panel.
3. Use `cd` to change terminal session working directory.
4. Stop an active command with the ⏹ stop button or `Ctrl+C`.
5. Click **Add to processes** to promote useful commands into the managed process list.

## 🗃️ Data & Logs

- 💾 Process configs and logs are stored under your app data directory.
- 📜 Logs are persisted per-process and streamed live to the UI.

## 🗂️ Tray Behavior

- 🔽 Closing the window hides the app to tray.
- 📋 Tray menu supports show/hide/start all/stop all/quit.
- 🖱️ Left-click tray icon brings the main window back.

## 📜 Scripts

From `package.json`:

- `bun run dev` → ⚡ Vite dev server
- `bun run build` → 🔨 Type-check + production web build
- `bun run preview` → 👁️ Preview built web assets
- `bun run tauri dev` → 🚀 Run Tauri desktop app in dev mode
- `bun run tauri build` → 📦 Build release desktop bundle

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### ⚡ Terminal command not found

- Verify the command exists in your PowerShell PATH:
  - `Get-Command <tool-name>`
- Restart the app after installing a new CLI tool.

### 📭 No logs in panel

- Confirm process status is `Running`.
- Check the command actually writes to stdout/stderr.
